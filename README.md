# Dedicated CS2-server-launcher

This is an simple Console Application for launching a dedicated CS2 server on Windows.
This is for the non-tech savvy who does not want to be doing this the hard way.

This application needs to be run as administrator, this is because we need to add a firewall exception to port 27015,
so that clients can communicate with the server locally. For anything internet releated, you are on your own.

1. Select game mode
2. Select map
3. Select launch server
4. Enjoy.

This is a simple solution before Valve makes a proper solution, use it at your own risk.
If you have anything you want to add, please make a PR or fork this progress, its no problem.
